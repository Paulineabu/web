Risk registers can become a list of worries if they are not owned. A practical risk register is different. It describes a real risk; it names the owner; it shows what has been done; and it is reviewed regularly until the risk is reduced or accepted with clear reasoning.

In governance roles, risk management is the bridge between frontline reality and leadership assurance. A ward might see a staffing gap today; leadership needs to understand what that means for safety, and what mitigations are in place.

The most useful risk conversations are honest. They describe the impact on patients, and the impact on staff. They also avoid false comfort; risk is not managed because it is written down. Risk is managed because actions are taken, evidence is collected, and learning is shared.

Risk management also benefits from QI thinking. If a mitigation is introduced, we should ask; did it work, what changed, what do we measure next. That is how risk registers stay alive.
