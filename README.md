# Pauline Abu — Professional Website (GitHub Pages)

A clean, modern, mobile-first personal website with a professional teal theme aligned to Pauline’s CV.
This is intentionally **not** a CV page — it’s a credible professional home with:
- Home (overview)
- About
- Expertise (domains)
- Timeline (career progression)
- Articles (blog-style pages)
- Downloads
- Contact

## What you need to add
1) Add Pauline’s photo:
- Put your image at: `assets/img/pauline.jpg`
  (Keep the name as `pauline.jpg` so all pages work.)

2) Add the CV file:
- Put the CV HTML here: `assets/files/pauline-abu-emirates-telemedicine-cv-v2.html`
  If you use a different filename, update the link on `downloads.html`.

## Publish on GitHub Pages
1) Create a GitHub repo (e.g. `pauline-site`)
2) Upload all files from this folder to the repo root
3) GitHub repo → Settings → Pages
4) Source: Deploy from a branch
5) Branch: `main` and folder `/ (root)`

Your site will be live at: https://<username>.github.io/<repo>/

## Add new articles
Copy `articles/article-template.html` and rename it, then add a new card in `articles.html`.
